                <p class="elaboration">
                    Sheikh Hamza Yusuf, born Mark Hanson in America 1958, is a prominent Islamic Scholar. His parents were originally christians.
                    But  his mother used to take young Sheikh Hamza to different places of worship like churches and even once went into a mosque.
                    <br><br>
                    He likes to read books and read so many books when he was young. 
                    <br><br>
                    Sheikh Hamza really started thinking about life after death when he had what he called a near death experience
                     from a fatal accident and he eventually converted to be a muslim and pursued islamic knowledge to his utmost capacity.

                <p class="elaboration">
                    To conclude, I want to quote one of Sheikh Hamza's long Sayings: <br><br><br>

                    "People say to you, 'you've changed', or
                    something like that, well, I hope, for
                    the sake of God that you have changed,
                    because I don't want to be the same
                    person all my life. I want to be growing,
                    I want to be expanding. I want to be
                    changing. Because animate things
                    change, inanimate things don't change.
                    Dead things don't change. And the
                    heart should be alive, it should be
                    changing, it should be moving, it
                    should be growing, its knowledge
                    should be expanding."
                    - Shaykh Hamza Yusuf
